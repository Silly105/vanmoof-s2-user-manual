# Brakes

## Adjust Brake Pads

Brake pads can be adjusted by turning the M5 hex bolt on the rear of the brake calipers.

To adjust, turn the bolt clockwise until the rotor can just spin freely without rubbing against the brake pads.

## Alternatives

The OEM Vanmoof brakes utilize a small braking surface, and requires adjustment constantly. Drop-in alternatives exist that do not require significant modification to the bike.
