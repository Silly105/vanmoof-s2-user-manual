## Error Resolution

### Reset the Smart Cartridge

The first step in resolving an error or issue with the Smart Cartridge is to reset it with the small reset button. Vanmoof has a guide on this (note, the guide is for the S3, but it's the same process for the S2).

1. Remove the Smart Cartridge from the bike.
2. On the right side of the Smart Cartridge, remove the small rubber flap.
3. Plug a mini-USB charger into the mini-USB port under the rubber flap.
4. Charge for 1hr
5. Return the Smart Cartridge to the bike, ensuring it's pressed firmly back into place.
6. Turn on the bike.
